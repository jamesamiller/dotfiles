#
#       PATH and MANPATH environment variables are set in two steps in macOS.
#       First, default environment variables are obtained from 
#       /etc/paths and /etc/manpaths. 
#       The /etc/paths file sets:
#           /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /bin, /usr/sbin, /sbin
#           NOTE: I suspect that homebrew or cask adds the /usr/local/bin part, since 
#           that contains a bunch of sym links to /usr/local/Cellar.
#       The /etc/manpaths file sets:
#           /usr/share/man, /usr/local/share/man
#           NOTE: Same here. I think /usr/local/share/man is added by homebrew or cask.
#
#       Second, the path_helper utility reads the contents of the files in the 
#       directories /etc/paths.d and /etc/manpaths.d and appends their contents to the 
#       PATH and MANPATH environment variables, respectively.
#       PATH can now also include:
#           /Library/TeX/texbin, /opt/X11/bin, and/or paths to other installed apps.
